# JSWQ-2.0
Upgraded from JSWQ 1.0/Like 2bored2wait but in exe/bat and you can change it to any server you want

#Setting it up
Setting it up is diffent from the old one because this is an program instend of .bat files
Just run the JSWQ.ink/exe and it will do it for you
then type "end" in the proxy console and "stop" in the queue console
after that go to JSWQ_PROXY_CONFIG and go to the bottom until you see "SERVERS:"
change the main server to any server that you want (Make sure that its cracked)
then, save and go into JSWQ_MAX_PLAYERS_CONFIG and set the max players for the main server. 
If you dont know what the max players is on the server ask someone or contact the admin/opertator of the server to tell you.
Once you have got it put it into the JSWQ_MAX_PLAYERS_CONFIG And save.
Then run the JSWQ.ink/exe and you have it done
